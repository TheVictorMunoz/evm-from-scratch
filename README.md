# Building the EVM from Scratch

We are going to build the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) from scratch. Every major topic is covered in a seperate Jupyter Notebook. 

In the end we are going to combine all the building blocks we created to create the EVM.

You can view these notebooks directly on GitHub or download the repository to execute and play around locally.

## Video Series

A video series covering these topics is coming soon. And will be uploaded to my (shafu) [page](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI9MdYsFm9h7W9jyP6Uxxbw) on YouTube.
